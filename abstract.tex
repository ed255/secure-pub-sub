Publish-Subscribe protocols, such as Message Queue Telemetry Transport
(MQTT), play a key role in enabling real-time multi-point to multi-point
communications for many emerging internet of things (IoT) applications.
Recently, there has been an interest in adding in-network processing
capabilities to such publish-subscribe systems to enable computation over
real-time streams to enable sensor fusion, compression, aggregation and
anonymization, correlation and other statistical analysis on sensor data.
However, unlike pure publish-subscribe systems which can employ transport
layer encryption end-to-end, it is challenging to ensure secrecy and confidentiality
with traditional in-network processing, particularly if the processing is
done on an untrusted third-party cloud server. We present the first secure
publish-process-subscribe system, which utilizes Yao's garbled circuits in
conjunction with novel cryptographic and system techniques, to preserve the
confidentiality of computations. We built a full-fledged secure
publish-process-subscribe system using our cryptographic protocol as a
foundation and incorporating novel system techniques. Our evaluation of the
proposed system using several example IoT problems shows that our solution
is computationally efficient.
