\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a secure publish-process-subscribe protocol and build a full-fledged
system with several new system contributions. Our system uses \MQTT protocol to
offer a lightweight protocol for publishers and subscribers.

Our system evaluation shows that our system is practical, efficient, and
scalable to run both basic arithmetic functions, such as, summation, minimum,
and variance; as well as more complex functions, such as, correlation and
linear regression, on a significant number of inputs. In particular, our system
is able to compute the one-dimensional linear regression of $600$ samples in
$10.5$ seconds. It can also compute $4$ basic statistical parameters (mean,
max/min, variance) on the daily accumulated data from streams publishing at $5$
minutes interval in less than $7$ seconds.

The most expensive part of our protocol is sending the garbled circuit, usually
more than half of the overall cost in garbled circuits.  The second most
expensive part is running the private-set-intersection protocol required to
detect malicious Publishers; which we believe could be improved in the future.
