\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed and implemented a secure computation protocol for the
Publish-Subscribe model.  By leveraging on the IoT \MQTT protocol we can offer
a protocol that is lightweight on the Publisher and Subscriber side.

From the evaluation of the system we conclude that it is computationally
efficient to run both basic arithmetic functions like summation, minimum and
variance; as well as more complex ones like correlation and linear regression
securely on a significant number of input values.
In particular, our system is able to compute the one-dimensional linear regression of 600
samples in $10.5$ seconds, it can also compute 4 basic statistical parameters
(mean, max/min, variance) on the daily accumulated data from streams publishing
at 5 minutes interval in less than 7 seconds.

In general, the most expensive part of the protocol is sending the garbled
circuit, being usually more than half of the overall cost in garbled circuits.
The second most expensive part is running the Private Set Intersection required
to detect malicious Publishers; which we believe could be improved in the future.
