\improvement{Explain how pub/sub works}

\subsection{Threat Model} We assume that the adversary can \emph{maliciously}
compromise a subset of subscribers and a subset of publishers. The adversary
can also \emph{passively} compromise either \broker or \garbler, but not both.
Malicious subscribers and publishers can collude either with \garbler or
\broker, but not both.

\subsection{Definition}

\improvement{Explain later that publishers cannot control which subscribers can
subscribed and similary susbcriber cannot determine which publishers will be
used. Publisher either allows data for all subscribvers or noone at all; this
is how pub/sub model works. However, \broker can control which entieies can
subscribe.}

\noindent\textbf{Ideal World.}
Our ideal functionality \F interacts with publishers, subscribers, \broker, and
\garbler as follows:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=20pt,itemsep=4pt,topsep=4pt]
		\item Each publisher sends a \policy to \F and each subscriber sends a
			subscription message to \F containing subscribed computation $C$. Let $S_C$
			be the set of $C$'s subscribers. 
			
%		Let $p_0, \ldots, p_{m-1}$ be the publishers whose data is required to
			%		compute $C$. 
		
		\item The honest publishers upload data to \F. The malicious publishers
			controlled by \Adv may abort (by not sending anything), sends their
			actual input, or send any arbitrary value that may depend upon their
			input, other malicious publishers' input, and auxiliary data. If a
			publisher value is not received before a time out period, \F uses a
			nullifying value for its input, e.g., $0$ for addition and $1$ for
			multiplication. 
			%We call $i$th publisher's input $x_i$; $0 \leq i < m$, $m$ being the
			%total number of publishers. 
		
		\item \garbler uploads to \F a one-time use pseudorandom mask $r$.

		\item \F determines a subset $P' \subset P$ of publishers whose data can be
			used to compute $C$. \F sends to \broker $P'$, policies of all publishers
			in $P'$, and $C$.

		\item \broker sends \F a subset $P_C \subset P'$ of publishers whose
			policies allow $C$.
			
		\item If data $x_C$ of all publishers in $P_C$ is enough to compute $C$, \F
			sends $C(\vec{x_C}) \xor r$ and $r$ to all subscribers in $S_C$,
			otherwise \F sends empty message $\bot$ to all subscribers in $S_C$. 

\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Real World.} In real world, \F is replaced by our
protocol described in Figure~\ref{fig:basicprotocol}.

\begin{mdframed}[style=myframe]
\begin{definition}
	\label{def:security}
	\textit{	
	A pub/pro/sub protocol is simulation secure if for every \Adv in the real
	world who maliciously corrupts a subset of publishers and a subset of
	subscribers, and only passively corrupts \broker and \garbler, with arbitrary
	collusion between malicious publishers, malicious subscribers, and
	hones-but-curious \broker and \emph{no} collusion between \broker and
	\garbler, there exists a simulator \Sim in the ideal world, who also corrupt
	the same set of parties and produces an output identically distributed to
	\Adv's output in the real world.}
