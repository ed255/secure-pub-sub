\section{Protocol}
\label{sec:protocol}

We propose two settings for secure publish-process-subscribe protocols:
(\emph{i.}) with an honest-but-curious external entity in addition to standard
publish-subscribe entities, publishers, subscribers, and a broker, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:pps-out} and (\emph{ii.}) without such an external entity as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pps-local}. First setting is suitable for less
resourceful subscribers, such as, mobile phones, and the second setting is
suitable for large organizations with hundreds of subscribers. We describe our
protocol and system in the first setting, but they could be easily adapted to
the second setting.

\input{settings}

We describe a base secure publish-process-subscribe protocol first, for ease of
understanding and reasoning about security, followed by extensions for reducing
communication and efficiently handling malicious publishers disrupting the
computation.  We present a simulator for the base protocol to prove that a real
world adversary cannot do more harm than a simulator can do in the ideal world
(Definition~\ref{def:security}). We also describe security of extensions. We
describe our system in Section~\ref{sec:system}, which is not a mere
implementation of our protocol, employing a variety of new system techniques. 

%We developed a range of system techniques, such
%as, developing a new high-level functional language to describe computations
%and generate circuits, extending garbled circuits library libgarble, identity
%gates to make our protocol compatible with Free-XOR optimization, and establish
%authenticated and encrypted channel on top of MQTT. 

%We assume direct authenticated encrypted channels in this section.  However, in
%our system, publishers and subscribers communicate directly only with \broker
%and communicate indirectly with \garbler through \broker as shown in
%Figure~\ref{fig:pps-out}. This allows us to implement our protocol on top of
%MQTT.

\subsection{Base Protocol}
\input{base_protocol}

The base protocol uses direct communication with \garbler for ease of
explanation; publishers and subscribers in our system communicate with \garbler
only through \broker. This ensures compatibility with a standard topic-based
publish-subscribe system where publishers and subscribers communicate only
through \broker.

Each new publisher initializes by sending its \policy to \broker specifying
allowed computations on its data. To subscribe computation $C$, a subscriber
sends a subscription request to \broker.  To publish a value, publisher
generates two wire labels $w_0$ and $w_1$ for every bit $b$ of the value, sends
both labels $w_0$ and $w_1$ to \garbler, and only $w_b$ to \broker. \broker
waits for a specified time period to receive all input wire labels after which
\broker requests \garbler to garble the circuit for $XOR \circ C$.  A malicious
publisher can send inconsistent labels for a wire to \broker and \garbler,
e.g., $w_0$ and $w_1$ to \garbler and a random wire label $w_r$ to \broker.
Inconsistent labels prevent \garbler from correctly evaluating the garbled
circuit. We use private-set-intersection-cardinality (PSI-C) to determine
inconsistent labels. \garbler hard-wires nullifying values for publishers who
sent at least $1$ inconsistent label and publishers who didn't send labels to
either \broker or \garbler. \garbler garbles the circuit such that evaluating
it outputs a masked output and sends it to \broker.  Therefore, when \broker
evaluates the garbled circuit, it only learns a masked output, which it
forwards to $C$'s subscribers. \garbler sends the output mask to $C$'s
subscribers, who can then unmask the output.

\subsection{Security Proof of Base Protocol}
We describe a simulator \Sim that simulates the view of the \Adv in the real
world execution of our base protocol of Figure~\ref{fig:baseprotocol}. Our
security definition~\ref{def:security} and simulator \Sim ensures both
confidentiality and correctness.

The interesting case is when a subset of publishers are malicious and are
colluding with honest-but-curious \broker. \garbler is non-colluding
honest-but-curious. A malicious subscriber only receives output; it can only
reveal its own output, which is also possible in the ideal world execution.\\[6pt]

\subsection{Reduced Communication Extension}
\input{extended_protocol}

We develop an extension to our base protocol, described in
Figure~\ref{fig:extended_protocol}, that allows publishers and \garbler to
generate wire labels for all input bits of a circuit independently.  Our system
uses this protocol.

Publishers and \garbler shares a truly random seed $s$ and use a pseudorandom
number generator to independently generate two wire labels for each input bit,
eliminating wire labels communication between publishers and \garbler.
Similarly, subscribers for computation $C$ shares a truly random seed $s'$ and
use pseudorandom number generator to independently generate output masks,
eliminating output mask communication between subscribers and \garbler.\\[6pt] 

\noindent\textbf{Wire Label Synchronization.} This method requires
synchronization between publishers, subscribers and \garbler; we explain in
Section~\ref{sec:system} how publishers and subscribers remain in
synchronization with \garbler using a round counter.\\[6pt]

\noindent\textbf{Forward Secure Seeds.} While this protocol significantly
reduces publishers' and subscribers' communication with \garbler, an adversary
stealing a seed $s$ from a publisher and colluding with \broker compromises the
confidentiality of all of the publisher's inputs, including past, current, and
future.  An adversary stealing the seed $s'$ for computation $C$ from a
subscriber and colluding with \broker compromises the confidentiality of
outputs of all executions of computation $C$.

We adapt key ratcheting protocol of Signal, a popular secure messaging
protocol, to make all seeds $s$ and $s'$ forward secure, i.e., an adversary
stealing a seed wouldn't be able to compromise confidentiality of any past
inputs and outputs. An adversary stealing publisher's seed $s$ and computation
$C$ seed $s'$ would still learn all current and future inputs of the publisher
and outputs for computation $C$.  However, an adversary learns a compromised
publisher's current and future inputs and outputs of all current and future
computations to which a compromised subscriber is subscribed to, even without
stealing the seeds. In other words, an adversary stealing seeds $s$ and $s'$
can only do as much harm in the real world execution as a simulator stealing
the same seeds can do in the ideal world.  Therefore, forward secure seeds,
provide the same protection as our base protocol.

\subsection{Efficient Wire Labels Consistency Check} 

In base protocol, Figure~\ref{fig:baseprotocol}, we execute a new instance of
private-set-intersection-cardinality (PSI-C) protocol for every input
bit of the circuit, which is expensive.  We present an efficient wire labels
consistency checking protocol in Figure~\ref{fig:label_consistency}, which we
use in our system.

This protocol uses Pinkas, et al.,~\cite{Pinkas0Z14} oblivious transfer (OT)
based private-set-intersection (PSI) as opposed to
private-set-intersection-cardinality (PSI-C) used in base protocol and only
\broker learns the intersection.  Running PSI alone cannot detect if a
publisher sends valid labels for different input bits, e.g., both labels $w_0$
and $w_1$ for input bit $b$ of $C$ to \garbler and $w'_{b'}$ label for a
different input bit $b'$ of $C$ to \broker. To address this issue, we use PSI
over masked labels.  \garbler and \broker shares a truly random seed $s''$ with
the first message of the PSI protocol.  \garbler and \broker generates a
pseudorandom mask $r_b$ for each input bit $b$ of $C$ from this seed; \broker
computes masked labels $w_b \xor r_b$ for input bit $b$ and \garbler computes
masked labels $w_0 \xor r_b$ and $w_1 \xor r_b$ for each bit $b$. \broker
learns all the consistent wire labels and requests \garbler to hard-wire
nullifying values for all publishers with at least $1$ inconsistent wire label.\\[6pt]

\improvement{We can hide $C$ using universal circuits.}

\unsure{Who forms the topics? Publishers, clients, or broker?}

\improvement{Using cut and choose for malicious security}

\unsure{What is our current model? Are publishers, subscribers malicious?}

\improvement{A publisher can always input wrong data, but there is nothing that
can be done for this? May be it could be detected if it is creating a real
problem.}

\improvement{A subscribing entity can setup it's own \garbler. First we explain
with \garbler as a separate entity and then later explain how it can be
eliminated by transferring it's functionality to subscribers. Similarly, we can
transfer some functionality to publishers. Which one of them is better?}
