\initialize
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
 
	\item Each new publisher sends \broker a \policy specifying allowed
		computations on its data.

\end{itemize}

\subscribe
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

	\item To subscribe computation $C$, subscriber sends a subscription request
		containing $C$ to \broker. If \broker allows subscriber to learn $C$'s
		output, it adds the subscriber to a list of $C$'s subscribers. 

\end{itemize}

\publish
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		
	\item To publish $k$th value, publisher generates two pseudorandom wire
		labels, $w_0$ and $w_1$, for each bit of the value. 
		
	\item For each input bit $b$, publisher sends only $w_b$ to \broker and sends
		both $w_0$ and $w_1$ to \garbler.

\end{itemize}

\process
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

	\item \broker waits for a specified time period $t$ to receive input wire
		labels, a single label $w_b$ for a bit $b$, from a subset of publishers
		$P_C$ whose policies allow $C$. After time period $t$, \broker sends
		\garbler identifiers of publishers in $P_C$ along with identifiers of
		publishers whose data wasn't received during time period $t$ and requests
		\garbler to garble circuit for $XOR \circ C$. $XOR$ is used to mask the
		output of the circuit.

	\item \broker sends \garbler the set of $C$'s subscribers $S_C$.
		
	\item \garbler generates a garbled circuit $GC$ for the circuit $XOR \circ C$
		using both wire labels for each input bit, $w_0$ and $w_1$ for a bit $b$,
		received from publishers in set $P_C$ hard-wiring nullifying value for
		publishers whose input labels weren't received by \broker as well as any
		publishers whose labels weren't received by \garbler. \garbler generates a
		random mask $r$ and use it to mask the output $o$ of $C$, such that
		evaluating $GC$ would result in a masked output $o+r$.
		
	\item \garbler sends $r$ to all subscribers in the set $S_C$ and $GC$ to
		\broker along with identifiers for publishers for which it hard-wired
		nullifying values.

	\item For every bit $b$ of the $C$ inputs, \garbler and \broker run a
		private set intersection \emph{cardinality} (PSI-C) protocol to determine
		wire labels consistency, i.e., if \broker input label for bit $b$, $w_b$,
		is one of the two \garbler labels for bit $b$, $w_0$ and $w_1$. If PSI-C
		outputs $1$, then the labels are consistent and if it's $0$ then the labels
		are inconsistent. \garbler will use nullifying values for all inconsistent
		wire labels. 
		
	\item \broker evaluates the garbled circuit using wire labels sent by
		publishers in set $P_C$ ignoring labels for which \garbler hard-wired
		nullifying values, obtains masked output $o \xor r$, and sends $o \xor r$
		to all subscribers of computation $C$.
  
	\item Subscribers in the set $S_C$ use mask $r$ to unmask the output $o$.

%\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, itemsep=6pt]

\initialize
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
 
	\item Each new publisher generates and sends to \garbler a truly random seed
		$s$. This seed will be used to create wire labels without interaction.

\end{itemize}

\subscribe
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

	\item In addition to registering subscription with \broker, subscribers for a
		computation $C$ also register with \garbler. \garbler sends a truly
		random seed $s'$ for computation $C$ and send it to every subscriber who
		subscribes for $C$; generating a new seed for the first subscription for
		computation $C$.
		
\end{itemize}

\publish
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
		
	\item To publish $k$th value, publisher generates two pseudorandom wire
		labels, $w_0$ and $w_1$, using seed $s$, for each bit of the value.  $w_0$
		is $i$th and $w_1$ is $(i+1)$th numbers in pseudorandom sequence generated
		using seed $s$; $2kL \leq i < 2(k+1)L$, $L$ being the bit-length of a
		value.

	\item For each input bit $b$, publisher sends only wire label $w_b$ to
		\broker.

\end{itemize}

\process
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

	\item \garbler independently generates input wire labels using seed $s$ from
		each publisher contributing input and an output mask $r$ using seed $s'$
		for the output.

ratchet key?}

\begin{figure}[h]

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]

		\item Generate a truly random key $K_0$.

		\item Generate, using pseudorandom function (PRF) with key $K_0$, a
			pseudorandom seed $s_0$ and a pseudorandom key for the ratchet round $1$.
			Seed $s_0$ is used to generate pseudorandom strings during ratchet round
			$0$.

		\item At round $i$, using PRF with key $K_i$, generate a pseudorandom seed
			$s_i$ and key for ratchet round $i+1$. Seed $s_i$ is used to generate
			pseudorandom strings during ratchet round $i$.

\paragraph{Garbled Circuit XOR Compatibility.}


* What if one publisher doesn't send wire labels. After timeout the broker can
inform the \garbler and it will use zero for such values in the circuit.

\improvement{We can hide $C$ using universal circuits.}
\unsure{Who forms the topics? Publishers, clients, or broker?}


\improvement{Using cut and choose for malicious security}

\unsure{What is our current model? Are publishers, subscribers malicious?}

\improvement{A publisher can always input wrong data, but there is nothing that
can be done for this? May be it could be detected if it is creating a real
problem.}

\improvement{A subscribing entity can setup it's own \garbler. First we explain
with \garbler as a separate tntity and then later explain how it can be
eliminated by transfering it's functionality to subscribers. Similary, we can
transfer some functionality to publishers. Which one of them is better?}
