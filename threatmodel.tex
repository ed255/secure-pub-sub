\section{Threat Model}
\label{sec:threatmodel}

We assume that the adversary can \emph{maliciously} compromise all-but-one
subscribers and all-but-one publishers. The adversary can also \emph{passively}
compromise either \broker or \garbler but not both. We also consider the case
where adversary can \emph{maliciously} compromise either \broker or \garbler but
not both. The adversary cannot learn anything about uncompromised parties
except what can be learned from the compromised parties data. \improvement{In
some cases this could leak significant information. How can this be avoided?}
