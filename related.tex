Privacy-preserving ridge regression

We do not use homomorphic encryption, our protocol is not limited to ridge
regression, doesn't need any interaction, and doesn't need any OT. We have a
completely non-interactive protocol. Our pub-sub model wouldn't work well
with interactive protocol. publishers are oiblivious of subscribers and vice
versa.
