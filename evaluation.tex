\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

% TODO: Setting.  Computer resources (CPU, RAM, OS).

\subsection{Setup}

We have evaluated our implementation in an environment consisting on two
computers located in the same gigabit ethernet network.  We run the Broker,
Third Party and one Subscriber on the first computer, and all the Publishers in
the second computer.  We perform all the analysis on the performance of several
operations in the Broker and Third Party, which run together in a computer
running Linux with an Intel Core i7-6600U CPU with 16GB of RAM.  In order to
avoid isolate the performance influence of the Broker and the Third Party, we
have serialized the garbling and evaluation of the garbled circuit operations,
mimicking the situation in which the Broker and Third Party are run on
different servers.

\subsection{Microbenchmarks}

We have selected 5 numerical operations of varying complexity (\emph{summation,
multiplicatory, mean, variance, minimum}) to evaluate the cost of the different
parts of our implementation.  We securely evaluate these functions over the values (encoded as 32 bit fixed point numbers) received from a variable number of Publishers.
