\initialize
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt]
 
	\item Each new publisher sends \broker a \policy specifying allowed
		computations on its data.

\end{itemize}

\subscribe
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt]

	\item To subscribe computation $C$, subscriber sends a subscription request
		containing $C$ to \broker. If \broker allows subscriber to learn $C$'s
		output, it adds the subscriber to a list of $C$'s subscribers. 

\end{itemize}

\publish
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt,after=]
		
	\item To publish $k$th value, publisher generates two pseudorandom wire
		labels, $w_0$ and $w_1$, for each bit of the value. 
		
	\item For each input bit $b$, publisher sends only $w_b$ to \broker and sends
		both $w_0$ and $w_1$ to \garbler.

\end{itemize}

\process
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt]

	\item \broker waits for a specified time period $t$ to receive input wire
		labels, a single label $w_b$ for a bit $b$, from a subset of publishers
		$P_C$ whose policies allow $C$. After time period $t$, \broker sends
		\garbler identifiers of publishers in $P_C$ along with identifiers of
		publishers whose data wasn't received during time period $t$ and requests
		\garbler to garble circuit for $XOR \circ C$. $XOR$ is used to mask the
		output of the circuit.

	\item \broker sends \garbler the set of $C$'s subscribers $S_C$.
		
	\item \garbler generates a garbled circuit $GC$ for the circuit $XOR \circ C$
		using both wire labels for each input bit, $w_0$ and $w_1$ for a bit $b$,
		received from publishers in set $P_C$ hard-wiring nullifying value for
		publishers whose input labels weren't received by \broker as well as any
		publishers whose labels weren't received by \garbler. \garbler generates a
		random mask $r$ and use it to mask the output $o$ of $C$, such that
		evaluating $GC$ would result in a masked output $o \xor r$.
		
	\item \garbler sends $r$ to all subscribers in the set $S_C$ and $GC$ to
		\broker along with identifiers for publishers for which it hard-wired
		nullifying values.

	\item For every bit $b$ of the $C$ inputs, \garbler and \broker run a
		private-set-intersection-cardinality (PSI-C) protocol to determine wire
		labels consistency, i.e., if \broker input label for bit $b$, $w_b$, is one
		of the two \garbler labels for bit $b$, $w_0$ and $w_1$. If PSI-C outputs
		$1$, then the labels are consistent and if it's $0$ then the labels are
		inconsistent. \garbler will use nullifying values for inputs of all
		publishers with at least $1$ inconsistent wire label. 
		
	\item \broker evaluates the garbled circuit using wire labels sent by
		publishers in set $P_C$ ignoring labels for which \garbler hard-wired
		nullifying values, obtains masked output $o \xor r$, and sends $o \xor r$
		to all subscribers of computation $C$.
  
	\item Subscribers in the set $S_C$ use mask $r$ to unmask the output $o$.
